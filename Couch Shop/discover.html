        <h2>What is Furniture Recycling?</h2>
        <p>
            Furniture recycling is the process of reusing or refurbishing furniture that would otherwise end up in a landfill. This process involves taking old, worn, or unwanted furniture and giving it a new lease of life, either by repairing it or repurposing it for a different use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furniture recycling can take many forms, including:
        </p>
